Google Panda:  
The main purpose is to punish low-quality and content-poor websites, so as to provide users with the most relevant and original search results. In short, the web page does not provide enough useful information for readers, excessively piling up keywords, trying to improve page ranking by improving the relevance of the web page to user queries, and websites that lack original content as the following three points will be punished by Google :  
a.Thin Content: The webpage does not provide enough useful information for readers.  
b.Keyword Stuffing:The page is over-stacked with keywords, trying to improve the page ranking by improving the relevance of the page to user queries.  
c.Duplicate Content: The web content lacks originality, mostly copied from other websites.  

Google Penguin:  
In the early days, when people discovered that backlinks are related to page ranking, they tried to establish a large number of unnatural backlinks, which are artificial, fake or tampered links pointing to their own web pages to improve rankings. In view of this, Google has published the Penguin algorithm to monitor the reverse link behavior of each website. All actions that use unnatural reverse links to manipulate page rankings may be punished.  

Rank Brain:  
To put it simply, Google’s search results are no longer based solely on the matching of web keywords and user query terms, but provide the most appropriate online information based on the user’s search intent. RankBrain has introduced an artificial intelligence system to more accurately determine the user's search intent, analyze the quality of the website's content, and optimize search results.  

Maeket share:  
Microsoft's Edge uses the same engine as Google, based on Chromium, and consumes less memory capacity compared to chrome. It has already squeezed Firefox into second place. Firefox is the default browser of the Linux system. What is more special is that the current market share of Apple computers can be roughly estimated from the market share of the browser on the PC side.  

On the mobile side, Android may have two default browsers: Samsung’s Samsung Internet and Chrome. Samsung Internet was originally a web browser pre-installed on Galaxy phones and tablets. Later, Samsung opened it to all Android devices.  

Samsung Internet is also based on Chrome, but has a fully customized interface, which is more in line with Samsung's user interface. Compared with Chrome, the advantages are tracking protection, and button layout that is easier to use on smart mobile phones.  

Baidu browser, currently only the mobile version is still being updated, and the PC terminal has stopped updating. Baidu Browser integrates many of Baidu's own application services, and is also trying to build its own user ecology.  
For Apple phones, all third-party browsers need to use the Safari rendering engine, and Google allows any web browser engine to be sent to Play for installation on Android phones.  

Advertising business model:  
Baidu and Google are also different in click ads. Baidu has Baidu Promotion and Google has Google Ads. The charging rules of the two are similar. Both are based on the bid and the quality of the advertisement to determine the click charge. However, compared to Baidu, Google pays more attention to the quality of advertising, while Baidu pays more attention to bidding.  
Google: Having a higher ad quality score can lower the price of ad clicks and save costs for enterprises. In addition, high-quality advertising will also win more potential customers for the company.  
Baidu: it is more inclined to bid, Baidu's automatic bidding system is more inclined to bid higher ads to get higher rankings.  

Conclusion:  
Baidu's investment in China's AI field is the earliest and has a comprehensive planning. The results cover multiple levels of software, hardware and algorithms. It has some similarities with Google and is a typical platform-based AI company.  
At the AI application level, Baidu leveraged the general trend of China's intelligent industrialization to apply AI in finance, customer service, urban, medical, autonomous driving and other fields through cloud computing.  
Since the real Chinese market share is based in rural areas, second-tier cities, and third-tier cities, these areas basically use Chinese mobile phone brands to access the Internet, and most of them are bound to Huawei or QQ browsers, and they tend to use baidu for Internet Search. These people are accustomed to using Baidu, not so easy to change their habits, so we believe that after Google returns to the Chinese market, the competitiveness of Baidu should be the same.
